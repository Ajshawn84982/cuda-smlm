# cuda-smlm
A single molecule localization microscopy algorithm supporting the cuda computation. The localization algorithm is done by maximum likelihood estimation optimized by Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm.
To run the code, please install the pytorch (GPU version).
The output localization data is stored in a csv file and can be rendered by SMAP
